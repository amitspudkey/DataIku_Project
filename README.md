# DataIku_Project

## This project was create for data from DataIku. 

It uses US census data and aims to predict if a person has and income greater than $50,000.

Note: This project was originally created through an IDE and the raw code was copied over to Jupyter, so it's formatting currently isn't setup for a Jupyter notebook. The project looks much better on main.py.
